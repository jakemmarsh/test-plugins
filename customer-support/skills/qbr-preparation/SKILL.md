# QBR Preparation Skill

You are an expert at preparing Quarterly Business Reviews that are strategic, data-driven, and actionable. You know how to structure QBR content that demonstrates value, addresses concerns proactively, and positions renewal and expansion conversations effectively.

## QBR Content Framework

### 1. Executive Summary (1 page / 2-3 minutes)

The executive summary should be concise enough for a busy executive to grasp the full picture without reading anything else.

**Structure:**
- **Relationship headline**: One sentence capturing the quarter's theme (e.g., "Strong adoption growth with an opportunity to expand into the analytics team")
- **Health snapshot**: Overall health score, trend, and one-line rationale
- **Top 3 highlights**: Biggest wins or value delivered this quarter
- **Top 1-2 concerns**: Honest assessment of challenges (showing transparency builds trust)
- **Key ask or recommendation**: What you want them to walk away with

**Tips:**
- Write this LAST, after all other sections are complete
- Use specific numbers, not vague language ("42% increase" not "significant growth")
- Frame everything in terms of the customer's business outcomes, not your product features

### 2. Usage & Adoption Review (2-3 pages / 10 minutes)

**Metrics to Present:**
| Category | Metrics | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| Volume | Total usage, API calls, transactions | Are they getting value from what they pay for? |
| Users | Active users, seat utilization, new users | Is adoption expanding across the organization? |
| Features | Features used, adoption depth | Are they leveraging the full platform? |
| Trends | MoM/QoQ changes, growth rate | Is the trajectory healthy? |
| Benchmarks | vs. plan limits, vs. similar customers | How do they compare? |

**Presentation Best Practices:**
- Lead with the trend, not just the number ("Usage grew 25% this quarter to 1.2M calls")
- Use visualizations: line charts for trends, bar charts for comparisons
- Always show at least two time periods for context
- Highlight inflection points and explain what drove them
- Connect usage metrics back to business outcomes ("This translated to X hours saved" or "Y processes automated")

**Usage vs. Entitlement Analysis:**
- Show what they're entitled to vs. what they're using
- If underutilizing: this is a churn risk — develop adoption plan
- If near/exceeding limits: this is an expansion opportunity — frame positively

### 3. Value Delivered (1-2 pages / 5-7 minutes)

This is the most important section for renewals. Quantify value whenever possible.

**Value Framework:**
- **Time savings**: Hours or days saved on specific processes
- **Cost reduction**: Dollars saved through efficiency or automation
- **Revenue impact**: Revenue enabled, deals accelerated, customer retention improved
- **Risk reduction**: Compliance improvements, error reduction, security enhancements
- **Quality improvements**: Better outputs, faster resolution, improved accuracy

**How to Calculate Value:**
```
Time Saved = (Manual time per task) × (Tasks automated) × (Frequency) × (Hourly cost of employee)
Cost Avoided = (Cost of alternative solution) - (Cost of your solution)
Revenue Enabled = (Deals influenced) × (Average deal size) × (Win rate improvement)
```

**If You Don't Have Hard Numbers:**
- Use estimates with stated assumptions ("Assuming 30 minutes saved per ticket across 200 tickets per month...")
- Ask the customer to validate or refine your estimates during the QBR
- Use qualitative value: testimonials, satisfaction scores, team feedback
- Compare to pre-implementation baseline if available

### 4. Support & Experience (1 page / 3-5 minutes)

**Present:**
- Ticket volume and trend (QoQ comparison)
- Average resolution time vs. SLA
- CSAT scores for the period
- Any escalations and their resolution
- Top ticket categories (shows where friction exists)

**Framing:**
- Low tickets = good experience (not lack of engagement)
- High tickets = you're responsive and they trust you (reframe positively, but address root causes)
- Escalations = show them resolved, with preventive measures taken
- Always close this section with what you're doing to improve the experience

### 5. Roadmap Alignment (1 page / 5 minutes)

**Structure:**
- Features or improvements delivered this quarter that benefit them
- Upcoming roadmap items aligned to their stated priorities
- Their feature requests and current status
- How their feedback has influenced product direction

**Guidelines:**
- Only share roadmap information that's approved for external sharing
- Frame in terms of their use cases, not product features
- Be honest about request status — if it's not on the roadmap, say so and explain why
- Position the roadmap as evidence of long-term investment in their success

### 6. Recommendations & Next Steps (1 page / 5-7 minutes)

**Structure each recommendation as:**
```
Recommendation: [What you suggest]
Rationale: [Why — tied to their goals and your data]
Expected Impact: [What they'll gain]
Effort Required: [What it takes from them]
Timeline: [When this should happen]
```

**Common Recommendation Categories:**
- Adoption: Expand usage to new teams, use cases, or features
- Optimization: Improve how they use existing capabilities
- Expansion: Upgrade plan, add seats, add products
- Risk mitigation: Address concerns before they become problems
- Strategic alignment: Adjust approach based on their evolving business goals

### 7. Renewal / Expansion Strategy (Internal Only)

This section is for internal preparation — do NOT present to the customer.

**Include:**
- Renewal risk assessment (Low / Medium / High) with rationale
- Expansion opportunity sizing
- Competitive landscape for this account
- Commercial strategy: pricing approach, term length, incentives
- Key objections to prepare for and responses
- Decision-maker map: who influences, who decides, who signs
- Timeline: key dates and milestones before renewal

## Data Collection Methodology

### Pre-QBR Checklist (2-3 Weeks Before)

**From your systems:**
- [ ] Pull usage metrics for the quarter (and prior quarter for comparison)
- [ ] Export support ticket data and trends
- [ ] Review CRM for contract details, pipeline, and account notes
- [ ] Check health score and recent assessment

**From your team:**
- [ ] Internal account review with stakeholders (product, support, sales)
- [ ] Identify any upcoming product changes that affect this customer
- [ ] Gather qualitative feedback from support and success interactions
- [ ] Review any escalations and their resolution

**From the customer:**
- [ ] Send pre-QBR survey or discussion guide (optional but valuable)
- [ ] Confirm attendees and their priorities for the meeting
- [ ] Ask if there are specific topics they want to cover
- [ ] Request an updated org chart or stakeholder map if needed

**From external sources:**
- [ ] Check customer's recent news (funding, leadership changes, earnings)
- [ ] Review industry trends affecting their business
- [ ] Note any competitive activity in their space or your space

### Data Gap Handling

When data is incomplete:
- Use the best available proxy metrics
- State assumptions explicitly
- Ask the customer to validate during the QBR
- Note what data collection improvements would help future QBRs
- Don't skip a section just because data is incomplete — incomplete data with context is better than nothing

## Presentation Structure and Best Practices

### Slide/Section Count
- Executive summary: 1 slide
- Usage & adoption: 2-3 slides (keep it visual)
- Value delivered: 1-2 slides
- Support review: 1 slide
- Roadmap alignment: 1 slide
- Recommendations: 1-2 slides
- Discussion / next steps: 1 slide
- **Total: 8-12 slides for a 60-minute QBR**

### Timing
- 60-minute QBR: 30 min presentation, 30 min discussion
- 90-minute QBR: 40 min presentation, 50 min discussion
- Always reserve at least 40% of the time for discussion — the conversation is more valuable than the deck

### Presentation Tips
- Start by confirming the agenda and time commitment
- Ask about their priorities before diving in (they may have pressing concerns)
- Be flexible — if they want to spend 30 minutes on one topic, let them
- Use their language and terminology, not yours
- Avoid jargon and marketing speak — be authentic
- Present challenges honestly — this builds trust
- End with clear, mutually agreed next steps with owners and deadlines

### Virtual QBR Adjustments
- Keep slides more visual (less text per slide for screen sharing)
- Check for engagement every 5-7 minutes (ask questions, poll, invite input)
- Send the deck ahead of time for complex or data-heavy reviews
- Record (with permission) for stakeholders who can't attend
- Follow up with written summary within 24 hours

## Success Metric Identification

### Defining Success Metrics with Customers

**During onboarding or success planning:**
1. Ask: "What does success look like for your team in 6-12 months?"
2. Translate their goals into measurable outcomes
3. Agree on specific metrics and targets
4. Document in a shared success plan

**SMART Success Metrics:**
- **Specific**: "Reduce ticket resolution time" not "improve support"
- **Measurable**: "From 4 hours to 2 hours average"
- **Achievable**: Based on realistic improvement potential
- **Relevant**: Tied to their business priorities
- **Time-bound**: "By end of Q2"

**Common Success Metrics by Function:**
| Customer Function | Example Success Metrics |
|---|---|
| Operations | Process time reduced, error rate decreased, throughput increased |
| Sales | Pipeline generated, deal velocity improved, win rate increased |
| Support | Resolution time reduced, CSAT improved, ticket deflection rate |
| Engineering | Development velocity, deployment frequency, incident reduction |
| Finance | Cost per transaction, processing time, accuracy rate |
| Marketing | Campaign performance, time to launch, content production rate |

### Tracking and Reporting

- Track success metrics monthly, report quarterly at QBR
- Show progress toward stated goals
- If metrics aren't trending well, address proactively (don't wait for QBR)
- Celebrate milestones and wins along the way
- Adjust metrics if the customer's goals evolve

## Using This Skill

When preparing QBR content:

1. Start data collection 2-3 weeks before the QBR date
2. Do an internal pre-brief with your account team before building the deck
3. Build the sections in order: data → analysis → recommendations → executive summary
4. Have a colleague review the deck for clarity, accuracy, and story coherence
5. Practice the presentation to ensure it fits in the time allotted
6. Send the agenda (not the full deck) to the customer 3-5 days before
7. After the QBR: send notes within 24 hours, update account plan, and schedule follow-ups
