# Competitive Intelligence

Framework for gathering, organizing, and using competitive intelligence in the sales process.

## Win/Loss Pattern Analysis

### What to Track for Every Closed Deal

**For wins, capture**:
- What competitors were involved?
- Why did the customer choose us? (in their words, not ours)
- What was the deciding factor? (price, features, relationship, timing, trust)
- Who was the champion and what motivated them?
- What objections did we overcome and how?
- How long was the sales cycle? Longer or shorter than average?
- Was there a specific moment the deal tipped in our favor?

**For losses, capture**:
- Who won and why? (in the customer's words if possible)
- What could we have done differently?
- Was it a product gap, pricing issue, relationship gap, or timing issue?
- Did we lose on merit or on process? (e.g., we had a better product but they had a better champion internally)
- Were there early warning signs we missed?
- Can we re-engage in the future? If so, when?

### Identifying Patterns

Review win/loss data periodically to identify:

**Win patterns**:
- Which competitors do we beat most often? Why?
- What deal characteristics predict wins? (deal size, industry, persona, use case)
- What sales activities correlate with winning? (demos, POCs, executive involvement)
- Which value props resonate most in competitive deals?

**Loss patterns**:
- Which competitors do we lose to most often? Why?
- Are losses concentrated in specific segments, deal sizes, or use cases?
- Are there common objections we fail to overcome?
- Do losses correlate with sales cycle length, number of stakeholders, or other factors?

**Use patterns to improve**:
- Focus prospecting on segments where you win most
- Develop specific plays for each frequent competitor
- Address recurring objections with better proof points or product improvements
- Escalate or bring in specialists earlier when facing tough competitors

## Competitor Positioning and Differentiation

### Building a Competitive Battlecard

For each major competitor, maintain a battlecard with:

```
## [Competitor Name] Battlecard

### Overview
- **What they do**: [one-line description]
- **Target market**: [who they sell to]
- **Pricing model**: [how they charge — per seat, usage, flat fee]
- **Market position**: [leader, challenger, niche player]

### Where They Win
- [Strength 1 — be honest about where they're genuinely strong]
- [Strength 2]
- [Strength 3]

### Where We Win
- [Our advantage 1 — specific and provable, not generic]
- [Our advantage 2]
- [Our advantage 3]

### Their Common Pitch
[What their reps typically say about themselves and about us]

### How to Position Against Them
- **If they come up early**: [strategy for when you know they're evaluating]
- **If the customer is already using them**: [displacement strategy]
- **If they come up late**: [strategy for when they're added to evaluation]

### Common Objections When Competing
| Objection | Response |
|---|---|
| "[Their product does X better]" | [How to address — acknowledge, pivot, differentiate] |
| "[They're cheaper]" | [Value-based response, TCO argument] |
| "[They're more established]" | [Innovation, agility, customer focus argument] |

### Landmines to Plant
Questions to ask the prospect that expose competitor weaknesses (without badmouthing):
- "[Question that highlights a known competitor limitation]"
- "[Question that surfaces a pain point their product doesn't address well]"

### Reference Customers Who Switched
- [Customer who switched from competitor to you — why and outcome]
```

### Positioning Principles

1. **Never badmouth competitors**: It reflects poorly on you. Instead, ask questions that let the customer discover limitations themselves.
2. **Acknowledge strengths genuinely**: "They're a solid product for [use case]. Where we differentiate is [specific area]." Credibility comes from honesty.
3. **Compete on your terms**: Steer evaluations toward criteria where you're strong. If they excel at feature X and you excel at feature Y, make the conversation about Y.
4. **Use proof points, not claims**: "We're better" means nothing. "Our customers see 40% improvement in [metric] vs. [benchmark]" means everything.
5. **Focus on outcomes, not features**: Customers don't buy features. They buy results. Talk about what they'll achieve, not what buttons they'll click.

## Objection Handling Framework

### The LAER Framework

For every competitive objection, follow this structure:

1. **Listen**: Let them finish. Don't interrupt or get defensive. Acknowledge you heard them.
2. **Acknowledge**: Validate their concern. "That's a fair point" or "I understand why that matters to you."
3. **Explore**: Ask a follow-up question to understand what's behind the objection. "Can you tell me more about why [competitor feature] is important for your workflow?"
4. **Respond**: Address the specific concern with evidence. Use customer stories, data, or demonstrations — not just assertions.

### Common Objection Categories

**Price objections**:
- Reframe to total cost of ownership (implementation, training, ongoing maintenance)
- Quantify the value gap (what does the problem cost them? How does your ROI compare to the price difference?)
- Explore what "too expensive" really means — is it budget, value perception, or competitive pricing pressure?

**Feature objections**:
- Understand the use case behind the feature request — often there's a different way to solve it
- Separate must-haves from nice-to-haves
- Share roadmap direction if relevant (without overpromising)
- Provide proof that your approach delivers the outcome they want, even if the feature looks different

**Risk objections** (too new, too small, unproven):
- Reference customers in their industry or of similar size
- Offer references, case studies, or pilot programs
- Address security, compliance, or reliability concerns with specifics
- Highlight executive team credibility and company trajectory

**Timing objections** (not now, too busy, next year):
- Explore what would change between now and then
- Quantify the cost of waiting (what are they losing every month they don't solve this?)
- Propose a low-effort next step (not a full evaluation — just a 15-minute call or a quick assessment)

**Status quo objections** (current solution is fine):
- Ask about pain points with current approach — even satisfied users have frustrations
- Share how peers are evolving beyond the status quo
- Highlight risks of standing still (competitive disadvantage, technical debt, opportunity cost)

## Gathering Competitive Intel from Calls and Conversations

### What to Listen For

During every customer interaction, listen for competitive signals:

- **Direct mentions**: "We're also looking at [competitor]" or "We currently use [competitor]"
- **Feature comparisons**: "Does your product do [feature]?" — often inspired by a competitor demo
- **Pricing references**: "Your competitor offered us [price/terms]" — may be accurate or a negotiation tactic
- **Objections with specifics**: Detailed objections about your product often come from competitor sales reps coaching the prospect
- **Evaluation criteria shifts**: If evaluation criteria suddenly change, a competitor may be influencing the process

### How to Respond in the Moment

When a competitor comes up on a call:
1. Stay calm and confident — never show concern or surprise
2. Ask: "What's drawing you to [competitor]?" — understand what they value
3. Acknowledge: "They're a solid company" — builds your credibility
4. Pivot: "Where we see companies like yours get the most value is [your differentiator]"
5. Plant a landmine: Ask a question that exposes a known competitor weakness without naming them

### Recording and Sharing Intel

After every interaction where competitive intel surfaces:
- Log it in CRM on the opportunity record
- Note: Which competitor, what was said, by whom, and the context
- Share significant intel with your team (new competitor, new pricing, new features)
- Update battlecards when you learn new information
- Feed insights to product team when competitors' strengths point to genuine product gaps
