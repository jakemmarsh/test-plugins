# Outreach

Framework for drafting personalized, effective sales outreach across channels.

## Core Principles

1. **Personalization is non-negotiable**: Every message must reference something specific about the recipient — their company, role, recent news, or shared context. Generic templates get ignored.
2. **Lead with their world, not yours**: Open with their situation, pain, or trigger — not your product pitch.
3. **One clear ask**: Every message should have exactly one call to action. Don't ask them to watch a demo AND read a case study AND book a meeting.
4. **Brevity wins**: Shorter messages get higher response rates. Aim for under 100 words for cold email, under 300 characters for LinkedIn connection requests.
5. **Value before ask**: Give something (insight, relevant resource, thoughtful observation) before asking for their time.

## Channel-Specific Best Practices

### Cold Email

**Subject lines**:
- Keep under 50 characters
- Avoid spam triggers (FREE, ACT NOW, limited time, exclamation marks)
- Reference something specific: their company name, a mutual connection, a trigger event
- Question formats work well: "Quick question about [their initiative]"
- Lowercase often outperforms title case for cold outreach

**Opening lines** (first 10 words are critical — they show in preview):
- Reference a specific trigger: "Saw you just raised your Series B..."
- Reference their content: "Your post about [topic] resonated..."
- Reference a mutual connection: "[Name] suggested I reach out..."
- Reference their job posting: "Noticed you're hiring for [role]..."
- NEVER open with: "My name is..." or "I'm reaching out because..." or "I hope this finds you well"

**Body structure**:
- 1 sentence connecting their situation to a pain point
- 1-2 sentences on how you help (outcomes, not features)
- Social proof if relevant (one line — a metric or recognizable customer)
- Clear CTA: "Would a 15-minute call next week make sense?"

**Formatting**:
- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences each)
- No bullet points in first cold email (feels like a template)
- No attachments in first email (triggers spam filters)
- No images or HTML formatting (plain text outperforms)

### LinkedIn

**Connection requests** (under 300 characters):
- Reference shared context: mutual connections, groups, content they posted
- Be genuine and brief — don't pitch in the connection request
- Example: "Hi [Name] — enjoyed your take on [topic] in [group]. Working on similar challenges at [company]. Would love to connect."

**InMail** (when no connection exists):
- Slightly more space but still keep concise
- Hook in first line referencing something specific about them
- Brief value statement
- Soft ask: "Open to a quick conversation?" works better than "Can I get 30 minutes?"

**Content engagement before outreach**:
- Like and comment on their posts for 1-2 weeks before reaching out
- Leave thoughtful comments (not "Great post!") — add a perspective
- This warms up the relationship before the cold message

### Call Scripts

**Opening (first 10 seconds)**:
- State your name and company
- Use a permission-based opener: "Did I catch you at a bad time?" or "Do you have a quick moment?"
- If they say yes to bad time: "When would be better for a 2-minute call?" (book the callback)

**Hook (next 15 seconds)**:
- Lead with a relevant trigger or pain point, not your product
- "I noticed [trigger/observation]. We've been working with [similar companies] on [outcome]. Wanted to see if it's relevant for you."

**Discovery**:
- Ask 2-3 qualifying questions before pitching anything
- Listen for pain signals and use them to tailor your value statement
- If no pain surfaces, acknowledge it: "Sounds like you've got this handled. Mind if I send something over in case priorities change?"

## Personalization Framework

For every outreach message, include at least ONE of these personalization layers:

| Layer | Example | Where to Find It |
|---|---|---|
| **Company trigger** | "Congrats on the Series C" | News, LinkedIn, press releases |
| **Role context** | "As a VP Eng scaling the team..." | LinkedIn title, job description |
| **Content they created** | "Your blog post on X..." | LinkedIn posts, company blog, podcasts |
| **Mutual connection** | "[Name] mentioned you're looking at..." | LinkedIn, internal CRM notes |
| **Technology signal** | "Noticed you're migrating to..." | Job postings, tech stack tools |
| **Competitive context** | "Companies moving from [competitor]..." | Industry knowledge, news |

## Follow-Up Cadence

Default cadence (customize in local settings):

| Touch | Timing | Channel | Approach |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Day 0 | Email | Initial personalized outreach |
| 2 | Day 3 | Email | Brief bump, add new value |
| 3 | Day 5 | LinkedIn | Connect or engage with content |
| 4 | Day 7 | Email | Different angle, new subject line |
| 5 | Day 10 | Phone | Cold call attempt |
| 6 | Day 14 | Email | Break-up email, leave door open |

**Follow-up rules**:
- Every follow-up should add new value, not just "bumping this up"
- Change subject lines after the first follow-up
- Vary the channel — don't send 6 emails in a row
- Break-up emails often get the highest response rates — use them
- After the sequence: move to nurture (monthly touch with relevant content)

## User Configuration

If the user has not configured their product value props and target personas, ask before drafting:

> "To write effective outreach, I need to know:
> 1. What does your product/service do? (one sentence)
> 2. What are 2-3 key benefits for someone in [prospect's role]?
> 3. Who is your ideal buyer (title/role)?
> 4. Any proof points I can reference? (metrics, recognizable customers, awards)"

Save this context for future outreach drafts in the same session.
