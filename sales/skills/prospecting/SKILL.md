# Prospecting

Framework for researching, qualifying, and prioritizing sales prospects.

## BANT Qualification Framework

When evaluating a prospect, assess these four dimensions:

### Budget
- Does the prospect have budget allocated for this type of solution?
- What is their typical spend in this category?
- Are they in a budget cycle that aligns with your sales timeline?
- Key questions: "What are you currently spending on [problem area]?", "Is there budget allocated for this initiative?"

### Authority
- Are you talking to someone who can make or influence the buying decision?
- Who else needs to be involved in the decision?
- What is the organizational structure around this purchase?
- Key questions: "Who else would be involved in evaluating a solution like this?", "What does your decision process typically look like?"

### Need
- Does the prospect have a genuine pain point your product solves?
- Is the pain significant enough to motivate action?
- Is there a gap between their current state and desired state?
- Key questions: "What's the biggest challenge you face with [area]?", "What happens if you don't solve this problem?"

### Timeline
- Is there urgency to solve this problem?
- Are there external deadlines or triggers driving a decision?
- What is a realistic purchase timeline?
- Key questions: "When are you looking to have a solution in place?", "What's driving that timeline?"

### Scoring
Rate each dimension as Strong / Moderate / Weak:
- **4/4 Strong**: High-priority prospect, accelerate pursuit
- **3/4 Strong**: Good prospect, identify and address the gap
- **2/4 Strong**: Needs development, focus on building the weak areas
- **1/4 or less**: Consider disqualifying or nurturing long-term

## Research Methodology

### Company Research
1. **What they do**: Core business, products, and services
2. **Size and stage**: Employee count, revenue (if public), funding stage
3. **Growth trajectory**: Hiring trends, recent funding, expansion signals
4. **Technology stack**: What tools and platforms they use (check job postings, tech review sites)
5. **Market position**: Key competitors, market share, differentiators

### Key Contact Identification
1. **Decision makers**: Titles that typically own budget and final approval
2. **Champions**: Titles that experience the pain daily and would advocate internally
3. **Influencers**: Technical evaluators, procurement, legal
4. **Blockers**: People who might resist change (incumbent vendor relationships, competing priorities)

### Pain Signal Detection
Look for these indicators that a prospect may be ready to buy:
- **Hiring signals**: Job postings for roles related to your product area
- **Technology changes**: Migrating platforms, sunsetting tools, modernization initiatives
- **Growth pain**: Rapid hiring, new offices, international expansion
- **Leadership changes**: New CxO or VP in your target function (new leaders drive new initiatives)
- **Funding events**: Recent raise means budget for new investments
- **Competitive pressure**: Competitors adopting solutions in your category
- **Compliance/regulatory**: New requirements that your product addresses
- **Negative signals**: Layoffs, budget freezes, leadership departures (may indicate deprioritization)

## Ideal Customer Profile Matching

When researching a prospect, evaluate fit against these ICP dimensions:

| Dimension | Questions to Answer |
|---|---|
| **Industry** | Is this an industry where your product delivers strong value? |
| **Company size** | Does their employee count / revenue match your sweet spot? |
| **Technology** | Do they use complementary technologies? Are they on platforms you integrate with? |
| **Pain intensity** | How acute is the problem you solve for companies like this? |
| **Budget capacity** | Can they afford your solution at list price? |
| **Decision complexity** | Is the buying process manageable (not 18-month enterprise procurement for a small deal)? |

### Fit Assessment
- **Strong fit**: Matches 5-6 ICP dimensions — prioritize and pursue aggressively
- **Moderate fit**: Matches 3-4 dimensions — pursue with awareness of gaps
- **Weak fit**: Matches 1-2 dimensions — deprioritize or disqualify

## When to Escalate vs. Disqualify

### Escalate to manager or senior resource when:
- Deal size is significantly above your typical range
- Prospect requires executive-level engagement from your side
- Complex legal, security, or compliance requirements beyond your expertise
- Multi-division or enterprise-wide opportunity that needs strategic planning
- Competitive situation where you're losing and need executive intervention

### Disqualify when:
- No budget and no realistic path to budget in your sales cycle
- The person you're talking to has no authority and won't introduce you to someone who does
- The pain they describe doesn't match what your product actually solves
- Timeline is 12+ months out with no urgency drivers (move to nurture)
- They're locked into a competitor contract with no near-term exit
- Company size or industry is fundamentally outside your ICP

### Nurture (don't disqualify, but don't actively pursue) when:
- Good fit but bad timing — set a reminder to re-engage
- Champion is interested but organization isn't ready
- Budget cycle doesn't align — re-engage when new budget opens
- Currently evaluating competitors — stay in touch for when renewal comes up
